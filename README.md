# Strapi with Docker and MySQL

I recommend having a node version between (including) 12 and 16. And make sure to follow the steps in order as Strapi requires the database to be up and running.

### Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

### Start up database

```
docker-compose up
```

### Start up Strapi

```
yarn develop
```
